                <h3>My Journey</h3>
                <p>
                  My interest in web development started when I was 23 years old and began
                  designing some web applications using HTML and CSS as a practice.
                  I wanted to land my profession as a web Developer, so I spent most of my
                  time designing various web applications as a practice out of interest,
                  using HTML and CSS, not having a clue what I was doing but loving every
                  second of it.
              <br />
              <br />
                  Then I decided to take my interest and basic skills to the next level and
                  joined a Bootcamp, where I received training on Full Stack Web Development
                  and got hands-on experience while doing four different projects using
                  JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3, React, MongoDB, Express, Node.js and Ruby.
              <br />
              <br />
                  I wanted to be the most hands-on professional, and make sure that
                  my vision wasnâ€™t tainted by the opinions of others.
                  <br />
                  In the end, I was so excited when people asked me who built my professional
                  website, and without hesitation, I could proudly say myself. Fast forward
                  to today, I am equipped to independently develop applications using
                  creative problem-solving as I have become fluent in multiple programming
                  languages. I can write clean and scalable code that is also user-friendly.
